# SSH Experiment 6 — Secure Shell Access (ReadMe)

This repository contains the files, commands, and documentation for **SSH Experiment 6**, commonly performed in networking or cybersecurity labs to understand secure remote login, key-based authentication, and basic SSH configurations.

## 📌 Objectives

* Understand how SSH works for secure remote access
* Configure SSH on a Linux machine
* Generate SSH key pairs
* Perform password-based and key-based authentication
* Modify SSH server configurations
* Test secure connectivity between two systems

## 🖥️ Requirements

* Two Linux systems (VM/physical)
* OpenSSH client & server installed
* Basic understanding of Linux commands

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### **1. Check SSH Installation**

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If not installed:

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### **2. Start & Enable SSH Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### **3. Find IP Address**

```bash
ip a
```

### **4. Connect to Remote Machine via SSH**

```bash
ssh username@<remote-ip>
```

### **5. Generate SSH Key Pair**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

Default location:

```
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### **6. Copy Public Key to Remote Machine**

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@<remote-ip>
```

### **7. Disable Password Authentication (Optional – Hardening)**
